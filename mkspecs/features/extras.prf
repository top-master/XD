# Provides extra/optional features to your project which maybe are

#
# Usage,
# add (to your `*.pro` file) `load(extras)` instead of `CONFIG += extras`.
#
# old usage was using "extras" environment-variable like:
# ```
# include($$(extras)/extras.pri)
# ```
#

CONFIG *= extras

extras = $$absolute_path($$PWD/../../src/extras)
INCLUDEPATH += $$extras/include
